1. Firmware do not have csrw pmpaddrN, pmpcfgN, mseccfg, or mtvec in code region
when boot.

2. Is the memory layout on the paper true?

3. Invariant 2 on the paper: a fixed entry and exit point to and from the Firmware compartment.
- Does F always start executing from the same line because there is only 
  one interface from P to enter F, even though P can invoke this interface
  in multiple places?
- Is this true that there is no interface from F to enter P, and that F 
  can only jump to Sally Port to leave F?
- How does this constraint relate to controlling the data that is passed
  between the compartments? I cannot find what bad thing will happen 
  without this constraint, for example, passing some malicious value as 
  the parameter.
